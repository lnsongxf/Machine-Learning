% The maximum tree depth is defined by "maxdepth" (maxdepth=2 means one split). 
% Each example can be weighted with "weights". 
%
% Builds an id3 tree
%
% Input:
% xTr | dxn input matrix with n column-vectors of dimensionality d
% xTe | dxm input matrix with n column-vectors of dimensionality d
% maxdepth = maximum tree depth
% weights = 1xn vector where weights(i) is the weight of example i
% 
% Output:
% T = decision tree
