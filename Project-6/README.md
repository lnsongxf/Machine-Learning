Other functions needed:
  1. kregression.m :  train a kernelized ridge regression; define fun=kregression(xTr,yTr,sigma,lambda)
  2. biasvariancedemo.m : generates a 2d data set from two Gaussian distributions and trains a regularized kernel regression. The error is decomposed into "bias", "variance", "noise".
