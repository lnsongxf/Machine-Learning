% function [indices,dists]=findknn(xTr,xTe,k);
% Finds the k nearest neighbors of xTe in xTr.

% Input:
% xTr = dxn input matrix with n column-vectors of dimensionality d
% xTe = dxm input matrix with m column-vectors of dimensionality d
% k = number of nearest neighbors to be found

% Output:
% indices = kxm matrix, where indices(i,j) is the i^th nearest neighbor of xTe(:,j)
% dists = Euclidean distances to the respective nearest neighbors

d = l2distance(xTr, xTe); %d: nxm
[dists, indices] = sort(d, 1, 'ascend');
indices = indices(1:k,:);
dists = dists(1:k,:);
