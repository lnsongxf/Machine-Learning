Taken: Spring 2016

Language used: Matlab

This is an advanced-level course in Machine Learning. The focus is on supervised learning, with an overview of unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning. Topics in supervised learning include K-NN, perceptron, naive Bayes, logistic regression, empirical risk minimization, linear regression, kernel machine, Gaussian processes, neural networks, SVM. Topics in unsupervised learning include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

  - Project 1: L^2 distance and inner product
  - Project 2: KNN
  - Project 3: Perceptron
  - Project 4: Naive Bayes and the perceptron
  - Project 5: Empirical risk minimization
